# Daily Work Scheduler

https://monicaclarelewis.github.io/work-scheduler/

## Description

A daily work scheduler that saves text inputs and colour codes the hour depending on the time of day with grey for past activities, purple for current and green for future. This application allows the user to plan their day, whether it's for work, appointments or plans. 

## Installation

Follow the link above to access the scheduler. The time of day is displayed in column one, text can be inputed into the centre column and the inputed text can be saved using the button in the final column.

By clicking the save button the inputed task is also saved to localStorage, allowing the user to refresh or close the browser without losing their input. 

The colour of the row changes throughout the day depending on the time so the user can see what tasks have passed, what they should currently be doing and future tasks.
